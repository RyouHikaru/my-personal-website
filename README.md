# My Personal Website

A personal website designed using Tailwind CSS.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my current skill in Front-end development and continously learn from it as I progress it every now and then.

### _Note:_ ###
_As it is currently WIP, I'm not confident that it is organized and well-structured yet, but soon, will be polishing it and eventually, publishing it online!_
